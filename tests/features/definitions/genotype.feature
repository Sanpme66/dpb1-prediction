Feature: Define Genotype

    A genotype consists of two haplotypes: one from each of an
    individual's parents. If both haplotypes are the same, then
    the genotype is said to be homozygous. If they are different,
    then the genotype is heterozygous.

    A genotype can be represented via two haplotype names joined
    by a '+'.

    Scenario Outline: Genotype names

        Given the genotype name as <Genotype>
        When evaluating the validity of the genotype name
        Then the genotype name is found to be <Validity>
